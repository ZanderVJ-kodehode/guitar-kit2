this was one of my javascript tasks i got, in this i hade to make a button that i can click or press a key to activate. It was easy when i new how it works. It may not be the best css but the javascript part works. I made 7 buttons, 6 of them there is a key you can press to make a 1 sec sound and the other one is a song that last for 18 sec that will work as a background sound.
